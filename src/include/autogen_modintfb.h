! DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE PLEASE !!
! It is here to signal that subroutine interfaces are generated automatically
! (see make_intfbl_f90.pl in the main directory) 
! Though never included, it is named like a header in order to make sure that
! a cleaning of the directory would not remove it.
! It may be helpful later to give some precision about the method how to generate
! the interfaces modules.

! The next line will tell the build system that interfaces should be auto-generated:
!#include "dummy.intfb.h"
